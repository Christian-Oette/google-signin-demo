# A demo implementation of a google sign in

I created this code to help you get started with google sign in,
if you intend to use it in a spring boot application.

The user is authenticated via google token in the frontend.
The token is then delivered to backend and validated. If valid, an authentication is set to access a secured page.

- Go to to get started page at the google developers page and configure a client!
- Configure a new project
- Create a client with your personal domain

Once you set up your project, you can later edit at the developers console.

- At apis and services choose credentials

The "TODO" comments are meant as a guide for you to add your own logic
